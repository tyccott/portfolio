            <h1>Wordpress vs. GitHub for Site Development</h1>
            <p>I have now produced and presented to you two websites with nearly identical content: one on wordpress, and one using github pages. The processes of building each site, however, were vastly different. There are several major differences, such as the learning curve of each method, the level of control, and the flexibility of the program.
                
                <br><br> Upon opening wordpress and creating a new website, you are guided on a loose but fairly linear process, using built-in features of the program to change the look and contents of your site. You can choose from a wide selection of pre-built layouts and designs, changing the particulars to fit your goal. The process of adding text and images to each page is mostly intuitive, but it doesn't offer much flexibility in layout or aesthetics. I'm sure there are more advanced options within wordpresses' system, but a user doesn't require many skills upon starting.
                
                <br><br> In Github, on the other hand, you start with a blank document. All changes to your website, in contents and design, are performed with HTML and CSS code. For this website, I spent hours learning how to work with Git and searching for the code needed to create what I wanted within my page. I found, though, that this method offered me far more options for the look and functionality of my portfolio, limited mostly by my own skill. Once I had the basics down, I ended up enjoying the process of working out the code and tweaking the aesthetics of my site. I'm sure with more time I would be able to expand on this and make it work better for my needs.</p>
